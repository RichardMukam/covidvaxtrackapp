# covidvaxtrackapp
Portfolio project for my AP Computer Science Principles Create Performance Task using MIT App Inventor.
Developed in 2020 amidst the pandemic that ultimately shut down function globally, my application does what many individuaals sought: a location that offers vaccines for the Coronavirus Disease 2019. My application serves as a hub for finding locations within the Washington DC Metropolitan Area, based on data from May 2020. In the effort for maximizing user count and effectiveness, assessbility options are available, as well as prompts for the user to match their location to the nearest vaccine location.
